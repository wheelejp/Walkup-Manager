# WalkupManager
Final app for showcase

This is my final project for my Intro to IOS App Development class. It was designed for little league teams to organize, pick and 
play their own walkup music. It utilizes multiuser funtionality through Google Firebase and stores images in Cloud Firestore. This 
class brought me and many other students from zero to full stack in the course of 5 months.
